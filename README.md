# A-B_Test_Analysis

## Introduction
A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists.

For this project, we will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. Our goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

## Technologies
During the project we used Python 3.8 as the programming language and the following libraries are used:
- pandas
- numpy
- scipy
- matplotlib
- Random
- statsmodels.api

## Procedures
During the project the following steps are conducted:
- Read the dataset of "ab_data" required for testing
- Data wrangling through solving the problem of missing data and data formatting
- Descriptive statistics
- Study the probabilities of conversions to the new page and of receiving the new page
- A/B Test by using p-value approach
- Regression approach
- Conclusion
